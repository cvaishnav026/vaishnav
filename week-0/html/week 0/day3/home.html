What is
<br>
Digital Transformation?
</p>
<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%;">
Digital transformation is the process of shifting from traditional approach to new ways of working and thinking using digital, social, mobile and emerging technologies.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Digital Transformation in enterprises is primarily about engaging with consumers using powerful digital services. This is now a consumer game where agility, ease of use, responsiveness, simplicity, and the key elements of design thinking are critical success factors.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Digital Transformations cut across customer experience, operation efficiency and the business model itself.
